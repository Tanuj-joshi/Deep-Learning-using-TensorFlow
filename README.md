# Deep-Learning-using-TensorFlow
Here, we have carried out some mini-Projects using TensorFlow and which are organised under three Topics:

  ### 1) Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
  
   ##### Following Projects are included in this:
    a) Build a neural network that predicts the price of a house according to a simple formula
           
    b) Create a CNN that trains to 100% accuracy on happy or sad dataset
           
    c) Train an MNIST classifier using convolutional and MaxPooling 2D layer to 99% accuracy or above.
  
  ### 2) Natural-Language-Processing-in-TensorFlow
  
   ##### Following Projects are included in this:
         
      a) Tokenize the dataset i.e.,(BBC text archive), remove common stopwords. Design a NN that can be trained on 
         this dataset to accurately determine what words determine what category
         
      b) Train on a large dataset, as well as using transfer learning of an existing set of embeddings. Explore 
         overfitting in NLP
         
      c) Run 2 Models using a sarcasm dataset: 1 with a Bidirectional LSTM as its layer and another with 1D 
         Convolutional layer. Plot the accuracy and loss of the two models and compare it.
            
      d) Take a corpus of Shakespeare sonnets, and use them to train a model with LSTM. Then, see if that model 
         can create poetry!
  
  
  ### 3) Convolutional-Neural-Networks-in-Tensorflow
  
   ##### Following Projects are included in this:
         
      a) Train a CNN on Cats-v-Dogs full dataset along with augmentation.
         
      b) Apply Transfer Learning to increase training accuracy for Horses v Humans. To avoid crazy overfitting, 
         your training should automatically stop once it reaches desired accuracy (95%).
         
      c) Use the Sign Language dataset (sign-language-mnist) build a multi-class classifier to recognize sign language
